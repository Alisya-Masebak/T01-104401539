        <h1>Televisions Energy Tips</h1>
        <div class="card">
        <p><strong>Size & technology matter.</strong> Larger screens and older tech (e.g., plasma) use more energy. Modern LED/LCD and OLED sets are generally more efficient.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Use the TV’s <em>Energy Saver</em> or <em>Eco</em> mode and reduce brightness where comfortable.</li>
        <li>Disable “always-listening” voice features if you don’t use them; they can add standby draw.</li>
        <li>Consider star rating and annual kWh on the energy label when purchasing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Placeholder note:</em> Insert simple examples of annual kWh for common TV sizes in Australia to make this page concrete.</p>

      <p>Samsung, Sony, and Hisense have the largest number of models on the Australian market.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chart 4: Which screen type uses the least power?</h3>
      <img src="charts/Chart4.png" alt="Bar chart of TV efficiency by technology">
      <p>LCD TVs consume the least power, while OLEDs use slightly more but offer higher performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chart 5: What is the relationship between screen size and power use?</h3>
      <img src="charts/Chart5.png" alt="Scatter plot of screen size vs power">
      <p>Larger TVs use more power — the relationship is clearly positive.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chart 6: What is the relationship between star rating and screen size?</h3>
      <img src="charts/Chart6.png" alt="Scatter plot of screen size vs star rating">
      <p>Star ratings are fairly distributed across all sizes; bigger TVs can still be efficient if well designed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>When choosing a TV, balance size, brand, and efficiency. 
         A 55-inch LED TV is common and energy-smart for most households.</p>
