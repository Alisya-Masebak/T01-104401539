        <p><strong>Size & technology matter.</strong> Larger screens and older tech (e.g., plasma) use more energy. Modern LED/LCD and OLED sets are generally more efficient.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Use the TV’s <em>Energy Saver</em> or <em>Eco</em> mode and reduce brightness where comfortable.</li>
        <li>Disable “always-listening” voice features if you don’t use them; they can add standby draw.</li>
        <li>Consider star rating and annual kWh on the energy label when purchasing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Placeholder note:</em> Insert simple examples of annual kWh for common TV sizes in Australia to make this page concrete.</p>

    <h2>TV Energy Insights: Data Story</h2>
    <p>This section presents findings from the Australian Government’s Television Energy Rating dataset. 
       The aim is to help Australian consumers make informed decisions about technology, size, brand, and efficiency.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Chart 1: What type of TV screen technologies are currently available in Australia and which are the most frequent?</h3>
      <img src="Pie Chart.png" alt="Pie chart of TV technologies">
      <p>Most TVs in Australia are LCD LED, while OLED is less common.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chart 2: What screen sizes are currently available, and which are the most frequent?</h3>
      <img src="Bar Chart.png" alt="Bar chart of TV screen sizes">
      <p>55-inch TVs are the most common, followed by mid-range sizes like 42–50 inches.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chart 3: Which brands have the greatest number of different models?<h3>
      <img src="Bar Chart 2.png" alt="Bar chart of TV brands">
      <p>Philips and Hitachi have the largest numbers of models</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chart 4: Which type of screen technology consumes the least amount of power?</h3>
      <img src="Bar Chart 3.png" alt="Bar chart of TV efficiency by technology">
      <p>LCD TVs consume the least power, while OLEDs use slightly more but offer higher performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chart 5: What is the relationship between screen size and power use?</h3>
      <img src="Scatter Plot.png" alt="Scatter plot of screen size vs power">
      <p>Larger TVs use more power — Larger screen sizes generally consume more power, and the relationship is as screen size increases, power use increases.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chart 6: What is the relationship between star rating and screen size?</h3>
      <img src="Scatter Plot 2.png" alt="Scatter plot of screen size vs star rating">
      <p>Star ratings are fairly distributed across all sizes; bigger TVs can still be efficient if well designed.</p>
      <p>Larger TVs often have lower star ratings, since they consume more power. However, modern LED and OLED TVs can still achieve higher star ratings even at larger sizes due to efficiency improvements. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>When choosing a TV, balance size, brand, and efficiency. 
         A 55-inch LED TV is common and energy-smart for most households.</p>
